Before using the script the templates should be updated. That seems that generic template parameters (for example <gmd:parentIdentifier> for the template.mtb.child.xml), which could be the same for all metadata records should be set first. The templates file are located in the folder "metadaten-templates". After that please update the settings.py with the corresponding configuration parameter.
